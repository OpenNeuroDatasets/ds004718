## Overview ##

### Background and Aim ###

In the field of neurobiology of language, existing research predominantly 
focuses on data from a limited number of Indo-European languages and primarily
involves younger adults, overlooking other age groups. This experiment aims to 
address these gaps by creating a comprehensive multimodal database. The primary 
goal is to advance our understanding of language processing in older adults and 
the impact of healthy aging on brain-behavior relationships. 

### Method and Design ###
The experiment involves collecting task-based and resting-state fMRI, structural 
MRI, and EEG data from 52 healthy right-handed older Cantonese participants over 
65 years old as they listen to excerpts from “The Little Prince” in Cantonese. 
Additionally, the database includes detailed information on participants’ language 
history, lifetime experiences, linguistic and cognitive skills, as well as extensive 
audio and text annotations, such as time-aligned speech segmentation and prosodic 
features, along with word-by-word predictors from natural language processing (NLP) 
tools. Quality diagnostics of the MRI and EEG data confirm their robustness, 
positioning this database as a valuable resource for studying the spatiotemporal 
dynamics of language comprehension in older adults.

### Dataset Contents ###

The datasets includes:
1. raw EEG and fMRI data 
2. preprocessed EEG and fMRI data
3. behavioral results
4. audio and text annotations
